## Projects

### Project 1:Analysing Customer Churn for a bank
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed a messy bank customer dataset using univariate analysis, duplicate removal, outlier treatment, missing value imputation, categorical transformation, and data scaling.
- Data Visualization for Churn Analysis:
  - Churn Rate Analysis: Created visualizations comparing average churn rates by Geography, Gender, and Tenure.
  - Data Distribution: Produced visualizations for the distribution of Geography, Age, and Credit Score to assess normality and skewness.
  - Combined Visualization: Integrated all visualizations into a cohesive subplot with proper labelling for comprehensive analysis.

### Project 2: AI-Driven Heart Disease Prediction for a Healthcare company

### Project 3: Advanced Sales Forecasting for an E-commerce company
- Forecasted future profits for All Sales Inc. using a year's sales data, focusing on data preprocessing, seasonality analysis, and advanced forecasting models.
  All Sales Inc. needed a quarterly profit forecast using sales data up to December 9, 2023.  
- Imported data, set invoice date as index, cleaned data, created new features, and analyzed seasonality.
- Analyzed trends, seasonality, autocorrelation, and stationarity; used visualizations to support findings.
- Implemented and evaluated Naive, KNN, XGBoost, SARIMA, and Prophet models; combined SARIMA with boosting for better accuracy.
- Compared models using error metrics; selected SARIMA and Booster combination for 88% accurate profit predictions.
- Delivered reliable profit forecasts and a comprehensive report for All Sales
- Inc., demonstrating superior model performance and clear communication of insights.

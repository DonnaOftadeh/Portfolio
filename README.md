## Projects

### Project 1: Analysing Customer Churn for a bank
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed a bank customer dataset using univariate analysis, duplicate removal, outlier treatment, missing value imputation, categorical transformation, and data scaling.
- Data Visualization for Churn Analysis:
    - Churn Rate Analysis: Visualized average churn rates by geography, gender, and tenure.
    - Data Distribution: Created visualizations for the distribution of geography, age, and credit score to assess normality and skewness.
    - Combined Visualization: Integrated all visualizations into a cohesive subplot with proper labeling for comprehensive analysis.

### Project 2: AI-Driven Heart Disease Prediction for a Healthcare company
- Analyzed a dataset of 319,795 individuals to predict heart disease risk.
- Developed a machine learning model covering data understanding, preparation, modelling, and evaluation.
- Conducted data preprocessing, feature engineering, and stratified sampling; evaluated Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, optimizing with stratified K-fold 
  cross-validation and Platt scaling.
- Enhanced model performance with Random Forest, boosting the F1 score from 0.173 to 0.241, and achieved a perfect project score.

### Project 3: Advanced Sales Forecasting for an E-commerce company
- Forecasted future profits for All Sales Inc. using a year's sales data, focusing on data preprocessing, seasonality analysis, and advanced forecasting models.
  All Sales Inc. needed a quarterly profit forecast using sales data up to December 9, 2023.  
- Imported data, set invoice date as index, cleaned data, created new features, and analyzed seasonality.
- Analyzed trends, seasonality, autocorrelation, and stationarity; used visualizations to support findings.
- Implemented and evaluated Naive, KNN, XGBoost, SARIMA, and Prophet models; combined SARIMA with boosting for better accuracy.
- Compared models using error metrics; selected SARIMA and Booster combination for 88% accurate profit predictions.
- Delivered reliable profit forecasts and a comprehensive report for All SalesInc., demonstrating superior model performance and clear communication of insights.

### Project 4: Advanced Image Classification Using Neural Networks for Ecommerce Product Recommendation Enhancement
- Analyzed the CIFAR-10 dataset, which includes 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each categorized into one of 10 classes.
- Developed and tested ten different neural network architectures and data augmentation techniques to achieve high accuracy.
- Started with a simple convolutional model and incrementally added layers, dropout, batch normalization, and data augmentation. Evaluated and compared models to improve performance.
- Increased model accuracy from 59.62% to 86.84%, surpassing the 80% target, with data augmentation and advanced techniques leading to the best performing model. Achieved a perfect project score.

### Project 5: Segmentation, Forecasting, and Personalized Recommendations for a Fintech Company

 - Developed data-driven marketing solutions for EasyMoney, including feature engineering to enhance customer engagement and 
   profitability.
 - Cleaned and prepared customer data, addressing significant missing values and ensuring data uniqueness. 
 - Created eight customer segments using K-Modes clustering to inform
 targeted marketing strategies.
- Built a recommendation model with SVD to predict user responses and
 optimize ROI.
- Implemented continuous KPI monitoring with a real-time dashboard to track campaign effectiveness and business growth.
